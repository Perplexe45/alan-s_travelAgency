msgid "The German Court ruled that use of Google Fonts without prior consent is a violation of Europe’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) because Google Fonts exposes the visitor’s IP address. Court’s ruling threatens a fine of €250,000 for each case of infringement if the site owner does not comply. If your website uses Google Fonts, click \"Run Compliance Check\" to make sure your website complies with the latest consent capture and cookie blocking requirements."
